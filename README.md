# ANF Hands-on program: Use ANF as PersistentVolume

> Learn how to use ANF on kubernetes environment. Three types of hands-on program

## [ANF for Static Provisioning](https://github.com/maysay1999/anfdemo01/blob/main/static-prov.md)

Static provisioning is basically an upfront purchase of storage that will be used to serve all your cluster’s needs. When using static allocation, administrators need to pre-allocate all PVs. This can be tricky, because to optimize costs and avoid additional allocations, you need precise foreknowledge of how the cluster’s storage resources will be used.

## [ANF for dynamic Provisioning with Trident](https://github.com/maysay1999/anfdemo01/blob/main/trident-dyn.md)

The other option is to use dynamic provisioning. In Kubernetes, dynamic provisioning means [PVs are created more organically](https://cloud.netapp.com/blog/understanding-kubernetes-persistent-volume-provisioning), giving your clusters an advantage when it comes to dealing with changing storage demands.

## [ANF with Astra makes k8s deployment much easier](https://github.com/maysay1999/anfdemo01/blob/main/astra-only.md)

[Astra Control](https://cloud.netapp.com/astra) offers stateful Kubernetes workloads a rich set of storage and application-aware data management services powered by NetApp’s trusted data protection technology.
